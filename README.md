# Salary-Prediction
Problem Statement
In this project, we will explore a dataset that contains various factors that contribute to an individual's salary, such as age, sex, education level, occupation, and so on. Our goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether an individual has a salary of less than 50000 or greater than 50000 based on these factors. This task can be framed as a binary classification problem where we classify individuals into two categories based on their salary range.

To accomplish this, we will explore the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, and preprocess the data. Then, we will train and evaluate various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Finally, we will choose the best-performing model and use it to predict the salary range of individuals in a test set.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict an individual's salary range accurately. This can have many real-world applications, such as helping organizations to identify and address pay disparities based on factors such as age, sex, education level, and occupation.

Task: To train a Binary Classification model to predict whether the salary of an individual is less than or greater than $50,000 based on several factors such as age, sex etc. Each row in the dataset represents an individual.
